GOAL OF SECOND ITERATION:

1. Simplify
- The functional api needs to be easier to follow

2. Code reduction
- The code needs to have less repetition

3. Data reduction
- The computer should process less data to get the same result

4. Code quality
- Each function should have a goal and achieve that goal well

5. Code reduction
- The code needs to have less repetition



VISUAL DOCUMENTATION:

A face, made of two tris:

0 -x -y                      3 +x -y
  |----------------------------|
  |                          / |
  |                       /    |
  |                    /       |
  |                 /          |
  |              /             |
  |           /                |
  |        /                   |
  |     /                      |
  |  /                         |
  |----------------------------|
1 -x +y                     2 +x +y

Using the 4 vertex positions, we can iterate a face by recycling 2 of the points
into 2 tris. The indices array will make this possible.

The array will look like so: [ 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 ]

So [ 3, 0, 1 ] is the top left tri, and [ 1, 2, 3 ] is the bottom right tri.

OpenGL will complete the triangle. So in tri 1, it automatically connects 1 to 3.

We are using this counter clockwise wound tri in this form so the gpu can leverage
pointer index reuse for the majority of the quad, and keep a mostly linear iteration.
This may seem like a micro optimization, but for millions of faces, this will make
quite a noticeable difference. The only outlier in this is the initial position.
