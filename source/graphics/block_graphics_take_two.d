/*

GOAL OF SECOND ITERATION:

1. Simplify
- The functional api needs to be easier to follow

2. Code reduction
- The code needs to have less repetition

3. Data reduction
- The computer should process less data to get the same result

4. Code quality
- Each function should have a goal and achieve that goal well

5. Code reduction
- The code needs to have less repetition
